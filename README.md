# Game Project
## Troll Maze
Game project for week 4 of Sparta Global training

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In order to show how my understanding and knowledge has developed over the first 4 weeks of the course.

## Functionality
This is a simple game that uses a grid based movement system with the ability to wrap round to the other side.

A random map of walls, stairs and a monster are generated on each floor and at the start of the game.

Walls can be broken and the monster must be avoided, you must reach the stairs to descend a floor and see how far you can make it through the maze.

A high score of the deepest floor reached is recorded and saved between runs.

## Implementation
