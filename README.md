#Game Project
##Troll Maze
Game project for week 4 of Sparta Global training

##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In order to show how my understanding and knowledge has developed over the first 4 weeks of the course.

##Functionality
This is a simple game that uses a grid based movement system and random generation to create mazes.

Walls can be broken and monsters must be avoided to see how far you can make it through the maze.

A high score of the deepest floor reached is recorded and saved between runs.

##Implementation
